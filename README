OpenOffice.org Spelling and Hyphenation
extension package for Serbian (Cyrillic and Latin)

Created by the Serbian OpenOffice.org community. For the licensing terms see
the included text in the registration/ directory. Learn more about Serbian OOo
native-language project at http://sr.openoffice.org

The extension package is based on the Hunspell dictionary and Hyphen
hyphenation patterns for the Serbian language. Serbian Hyphen Hyphenation
patterns are derived from TeX Serbocroatian patterns created by Dejan 
Muhamedagic.
